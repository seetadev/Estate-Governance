# Estate-Governance
Real Estate Governance powered by FVM/FEVM and a suite of Filecoin blockchain protocols and solutions.

Enable effective registration and property transfer management, building maintenance communication and a technical solution for security and monitoring incidents using Filecoin powered by FEVM, Ethereum, IPFS, NFT.Storage and OSS AI; enable early detection and prevention of incidents.


Platform Features:

•Registration Management : Property Registration and Transfer Management using smart contracts compiled using EVM (title transfer.sol) and FEVM (house_tax.sol).

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data using a Filecoin/IPFS powered security based solution.

•Detection : Identifying the security threats in the video feed using object detection.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the property owners, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Building Maintenance: Reminder and timely notifications for maintenance activities using an Alexa skill. 

•Analysis : Analyzing incidents.

Registration Management: Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/Estate-Governance/tree/main/Registration-Management. Workflow of the app and deployment of smart contracts on EVM and FEVM at Registration Management Module (please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/18mAiA9L8UItb_BgW4w47lnc5K4xgLDxm)

Our platform solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of security cameras deployed at monitoring spots in the real estate.

Our platform will provide the requisites features to share security conditions and remotely monitor the management policies in a place using used and broken phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the businesses living in a variety of geographical regions. We also utilized open source ethercalc spreadsheets and its apis, compiled the smart contracts to EVM and FEVM for developing monitoring and a management application.

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration to Filecoin for snapshots of road incidents.

Object Detection using OSS AI library based solution.

Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage, security and data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, Filecoin for snapshots.

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to FEVM. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. 


# Filecoin and FEVM 

Our FEVM powered solution will enable better coordination, enable safety at residential societies and real estate properties to be more effective, proactive, help in early prediction and prevention of accidents/ incidents. Please find the details of Filecoin/IPFS powered solution with smart contracts compiled in EVM and FEVM: 


1. Property Registration and Transfer Management using smart contracts compiled using EVM (title transfer.sol) and FEVM (house_tax.sol). The workflow of the app and deployment of smart contracts on EVM and FEVM at Registration Management Module (please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/18mAiA9L8UItb_BgW4w47lnc5K4xgLDxm).     
  
2. We are using Filecoin based FEVM lending pool library to enable third party administrators to issue mortgage loans and their reimbursement/claims to the home buyers in financial distress.                                 
 
3. We are also using Filecoin for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the demo video at  (demo.mp4 under Monitoring demo directory at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18mAiA9L8UItb_BgW4w47lnc5K4xgLDxm). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to FEVM. Further we are using Filecoin for: Video analytics configuration using Filecoin/IPFS; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with oss streaming; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.
